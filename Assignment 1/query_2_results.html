      <td>Coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is a newly discovered highly pathogenic virus that was declared pandemic in March 2020 by the World Health Organization. The virus affects the respiratory system, produces an inflammatory storm that causes lung damage and respiratory dysfunction. It infects humans of all ages. The Covid-19 takes a more severe course in individuals with chronic metabolic diseases such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. This category of persons exhibits weak immune activity and decreased levels of endogenous antioxidants. Melatonin is a multifunctional signaling hormone synthesized and secreted primarily by the pineal gland. It is a potent antioxidant with immunomodulatory action and has remarkable anti-inflammatory effects under a variety of circumstances. Regarding Covid-19 and metabolic syndrome, adequate information about the relationship between these two comorbidities is required for better management of these patients. Since Covid-19 infection and complications involve severe inflammation and oxidative stress in people with obesity and diabetes, we anticipated the inclusion of melatonin, as powerful antioxidant, within proposed treatment protocols. In this context, melatonin is a potential and promising agent to help overcome Covid-19 infection and boost the immune system in healthy persons and obese and diabetic patients. This review summarizes some evidence from recently published reports on the utility of melatonin as a potential adjuvant in Covid-19-infected individuals with diabetes and obesity.</td>

Globally, it has affected 40,373,228 individuals and resulted in 1,119,568 deaths as of October 19, 2020. Research studies have demonstrated that geriatric population is vastly vulnerable to COVID-19 morbidity and mortality given their age and preexisting chronic comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic pulmonary and chronic kidney disease The data regarding susceptibility of elderly population to COVID-19 is accruing and suggests that factors like age, gender, chronic comorbidity, inflammaging, immunosenescence and renin angiotensin system may be the contributing risk factors towards COVID-19 and associated mortality in elderly population. Based on updated scientific literature, this narrative review précises the clinical presentations and underlying risk factors that might be associated with COVID-19 morbidity in geriatric population and provides informed insights, and discusses clinical presentation, psychosocial impact, mortality and potential corticosteroid treatment and prevention strategies of COVID-19 in older adults.</td>
      <td>ABSTRACT OBJECTIVES Current demographic information from China reports that 10-19% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 were diabetic. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered first-line agents in diabetics due to their nephroprotective effects but administration of these drugs leads to upregulation of angiotensin-converting-enzyme-2 (ACE2), responsible for viral entry of severe-acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome, coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Data is lacking to determine what pulmonary effects ACEIs/ARBs may have in patients with diabetes, which could be relevant in the management of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In this study, the aim was to assess the prevalence of pulmonary adverse drug effects (ADEs) in diabetic patients taking ACEI or ARBs to help provide guidance as to how these medications could affect outcomes in acute respiratory illness, such as SARS-CoV-2 infection. METHODS 1DATA, a unique data platform resulting from collaboration across veterinary and human healthcare, utilized an intelligent medicine recommender system (1DrugAssist) developed using several national and international databases, to evaluate all ADEs reported to the FDA for patients with diabetes taking ACEIs or ARBs. RESULTS Mining of this data elucidated the proportion of a cluster of pulmonary ADEs associated with specific medications in these classes, which may aid healthcare professionals in understanding how these medications could worsen or predispose patients with diabetes to infections affecting the respiratory system specifically, COVID-19. Based on this data mining, Captopril was found to have a statistically significantly higher incidence of pulmonary ADEs compared to other ACEIs (P = 0.005) as well as ARBs (P = 0.012), though other specific drugs also had important pulmonary ADEs associated with their use. CONCLUSION These analyses suggest that pharmacists and clinicians will need to consider specific medication’s adverse event profile, particularly captopril, and how this profile may affect infections and other acute disease states that alter pulmonary function, such as COVID-19.</td>

The effects of cigarette smoking on the transmission of the virus and worsening of COVID-19 have been less addressed.

      <td>AIMS: Analyze the relationship between obesity and influenza. METHODS: Basal hormone milieu, defective response of both innate and adaptive immune system and sedentariness are major determinants in the severity of influenza viral infection in obese patients. Being overweight not only increases the risk of infection and of complications for the single obese person, but a large prevalence of obese individuals within the population might increase the chance of appearance of more virulent viral strain, prolongs the virus shedding throughout the total population and eventually might increase overall mortality rate of an influenza pandemic. RESULTS: Waiting for the development of a vaccination against COVID-19, isolation of positive cases and social distancing are the primary interventions. Nonetheless, evidence from previous influenza pandemics suggests the following interventions aimed at improving immune response: (1) lose weight with a mild caloric restriction; (2) include AMPK activators and PPAR gamma activators in the drug treatment for obesity associated with diabetes; and (3) practice mild-to-moderate physical exercise.

      <td>Periodontal disease is a chronic multifactorial infectious and inflammatory disease associated with several chronic systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hypertension, Alzheimer’s disease and so on. These same systemic diseases have been associated with severe COVID-19 infections. Periodontal disease is one of the most prevalent diseases globally. Several recent studies have also suggested hypotheses for the potential association between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19. All this supports the importance of good oral health also in the COVID-19 era. Thus, new strategies and approaches to identify patients at risk of periodontal disease could be beneficial to enhance secondary prevention, especially if targeted to COVID-19 risk groups. Diagnostic biomarkers for periodontal disease have been researched extensively. Potential biomarkers in oral fluid with currently available rapid non-invasive point-of-care technology, such as aMMP-8, could help to extend screening and identification of patients at risk for periodontal disease even to situations and places where professional dental expertise and equipment are limited or unavailable such as nursing and care homes, and rural and distant places. The oral fluid point-of-care technologies could also be useful in the hands of medical professionals (diabetes, CVD, etc.) to identify patients at risk for undiagnosed periodontal disease and to refer them to a dentist for examination and evaluation. Finally, if there is a causality between periodontal disease and severe COVID-19 infections, these point-of-care oral fluid biomarker technologies could possibly help also in assessing the risk of deterioration.</td>

      <td>Given the high transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on our health system. Even in developed countries, strategic resources soon become insufficient. Although people over 60 and with comorbidities are at greater risk of developing severe forms, younger people may also require precious and scarce care. Hence, the World Health Organization recommend tests - PCR and serological tests - for detecting infected people on a large scale. The most common symptoms are fever, fatigue, dry cough, anorexia, myalgia, and dyspnea, with tomographic pulmonary findings being frequent even in asymptomatic cases. The Brazilian Society of Nephrology has published guidelines for the management of hypertensive, diabetic, dialysis, and transplant patients. In its alerts, care and precautions in dialysis units are also being detailed, both for the health team and for the patients. Although important renal manifestations are not yet evident in the admission of positive cases, recent studies with renal patients and performed in nephrology services are listed here.

      <td>BACKGROUND: The ferocious global assault of COVID-19 continues. Critically ill patients witnessed significantly higher mortality than severe and moderate ones. Herein, we aim to comprehensively delineate clinical features of COVID-19 and explore risk factors of developing critical disease. METHODS: This is a Mini-national multicenter, retrospective, cohort study involving 2,387 consecutive COVID-19 inpatients that underwent discharge or death between January 27 and March 21, 2020. After quality control, 2,044 COVID-19 inpatients were enrolled. Electronic medical records were collected to identify the risk factors of developing critical COVID-19. FINDINGS: The severity of COVID-19 climbed up straightly with age. Critical group was characterized by higher proportion of dyspnea, systemic organ damage, and long-lasting inflammatory storm. All-cause mortality of critical group was 85•45%, by contrast with 0•58% for severe group and 0•18% for moderate group. Logistic regression revealed that sex was an effect modifier for hypertension and coronary heart disease (CHD), where hypertension and CHD were risk factors solely in males. Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of critical illness associated with hypertension, CHD, tumor, and age ≥ 60 years for male, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), tumor, and age ≥ 60 years for female. INTERPRETATION: We provide comprehensive front-line information about different severity of COVID-19 and insights into different risk factors associated with critical COVID-19 between sexes. These results highlight the significance of dividing risk factors between sexes in clinical and epidemiologic works of COVID-19, and perhaps other coronavirus appearing in future.

      <td>Remdesivir dry powder for inhalation was previously developed using thin film freezing (TFF). A single-dose 24-hour pharmacokinetic study in hamsters, a small animal model for SARS-CoV-2, demonstrated that pulmonary delivery of TFF remdesivir can achieve plasma remdesivir and GS-441524 levels higher than the reported EC50s of both remdesivir and GS-441524 (in human epithelial cells) over 20 hours. The half-life of GS-4412524 following dry powder insufflation was about 7 hours, suggesting the dosing regimen would be twice daily administration. Although the remdesivir-Captisol® (80/20 w/w) formulation showed faster and greater absorption of remdesivir and GS-4412524 in the lung, remdesivir-leucine (80/20 w/w) exhibited a greater Cmax with shorter Tmax and lower AUC of GS-441524, indicating lower total drug exposure is required to achieve a high effective concentration against SAR-CoV-2. In conclusion, remdesivir dry powder for inhalation would be a promising alternative dosage form for the treatment of COVID-19 disease.</td>
      <td>INTRODUCTION: Early use of corticosteroids in patients affected by pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection, although relatively common, remains controversial. METHODS: Prospective, observational, multicenter study from 23 June 2009 through 11 February 2010, reported in the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) H1N1 registry. RESULTS: Two hundred twenty patients admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) with completed outcome data were analyzed. Invasive mechanical ventilation was used in 155 (70.5%). Sixty-seven (30.5%) of the patients died in ICU and 75 (34.1%) whilst in hospital. One hundred twenty-six (57.3%) patients received corticosteroid therapy on admission to ICU. Patients who received corticosteroids were significantly older and were more likely to have coexisting asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic steroid use. These patients receiving corticosteroids had increased likelihood of developing hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) [26.2% versus 13.8%, p &lt; 0.05; odds ratio (OR) 2.2, confidence interval (CI) 1.1–4.5]. Patients who received corticosteroids had significantly higher ICU mortality than patients who did not (46.0% versus 18.1%, p &lt; 0.01; OR 3.8, CI 2.1–7.2). Cox regression analysis adjusted for severity and potential confounding factors identified that early use of corticosteroids was not significantly associated with mortality [hazard ratio (HR) 1.3, 95% CI 0.7–2.4, p = 0.4] but was still associated with an increased rate of HAP (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.0–4.8, p &lt; 0.05). When only patients developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were analyzed, similar results were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Early use of corticosteroids in patients affected by pandemic (H1N1)v influenza A infection did not result in better outcomes and was associated with increased risk of superinfections.</td>

      <td>Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the cause of the global coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Along with the respiratory tract, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract is one of the main extra-pulmonary targets of SARS-CoV-2 with respect to symptom occurrence and is a potential route for virus transmission, most likely due to the presence of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of GI injury is crucial for a harmonized therapeutic strategy against COVID-19. This review summarizes the current evidence for the clinical features of and possible pathogenic mechanisms leading to GI injury in COVID-19.</td>
      <td>PURPOSE: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a topic of concern worldwide; however, the impacts of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on disease severity, therapeutic effect, and mortality of patients with COVID-19 are unclear. METHODS: All consecutive patients with COVID-19 admitted to the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University from January 11 to February 6, 2020, were included in this study. RESULTS: A total of 663 patients with COVID-19 were included, while 67 patients with T2DM accounted for 10.1% of the total. Compared with patients with COVID-19 without T2DM, those with T2DM were older (aged 66 years vs 57 years; P &lt; 0.001) and had a male predominance (62.7% vs 37.3%; P = 0.019) and higher prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (61.2% vs 20.6%; P &lt; 0.001) and urinary diseases (9% vs 2.5%; P = 0.014). Patients with T2DM were prone to developing severe (58.2% vs 46.3%; P = 0.002) and critical COVID-19 (20.9% vs 13.4%; P = 0.002) and having poor therapeutic effect (76.1% vs 60.4%; P = 0.017). But there was no obvious difference in the mortality between patients with COVID-19 with and without T2DM (4.5% vs 3.7%; P = 0.732). Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified that T2DM was associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 (odd ratio [OR] 2.99; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07-8.66; P = 0.04). Moreover, having a severe and critical COVID-19 condition (OR 3.27; 95% CI, 1.02-9.00; P = 0.029) and decreased lymphocytes (OR 1.59; 95% CI, 1.10-2.34; P = 0.016) were independent risk factors associated with poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19 with T2DM. CONCLUSIONS: T2DM influenced the disease severity and therapeutic effect and was one of the independent risk factors for poor therapeutic effect in patients with COVID-19.</td>

      <td>The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has evolved into a pandemic of unheard proportions. Given the havoc wreaked by this pathogen worldwide, many countries have adopted an extreme, legally enforced method of social distancing, in the form of a lockdown. Unless appropriate preventive steps are taken, the cost of the pandemic and ensuing lockdown may prove to be irreparable. The evident implications of this lockdown, such as the escalating levels of unemployment, impending economic collapse, and severe food shortage faced by the sudden unemployed migrant labor population, have been widely reported. Cancer patients are a particularly vulnerable group even during nonpandemic times, often presenting late in the course of their disease, without the resources needed to avail recommended treatment. The prevalence of psychiatric complications and emotional distress is significantly higher than in the general population, and the trauma of both the pandemic and subsequent lockdown adds significantly to their mental trauma. This review is aimed toward addressing the problems faced by cancer patients in the face of this pandemic and subsequent lockdown, with a glimpse into possible solutions that can be implemented.</td>
      <td>The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that emerged in late 2019 has spread globally, causing a pandemic of respiratory illness designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Robust blood biomarkers that reflect tissue damage are urgently needed to better stratify and triage infected patients. Here, we use spatial transcriptomics to generate an in-depth picture of the pulmonary transcriptional landscape of COVID-19 (10 patients), pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) influenza (5) and uninfected control patients (4). Host transcriptomics showed a significant upregulation of genes associated with inflammation, type I interferon production, coagulation and angiogenesis in the lungs of COVID-19 patients compared to non-infected controls. SARS-CoV-2 was non-uniformly distributed in lungs with few areas of high viral load and these were largely only associated with an increased type I interferon response. A very limited number of genes were differentially expressed between the lungs of influenza and COVID-19 patients. Specific interferon-associated genes (including IFI27) were identified as candidate novel biomarkers for COVID-19 differentiating this COVID-19 from influenza. Collectively, these data demonstrate that spatial transcriptomics is a powerful tool to identify novel gene signatures within tissues, offering new insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-COV-2 to aid in patient triage and treatment.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: Infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is now a global pandemic. Emerging results indicate a dysregulated immune response. Given the role of CCR5 in immune cell migration and inflammation, we investigated the impact of CCR5 blockade via the CCR5-specific antibody leronlimab on clinical, immunological and virological parameters in patients with severe COVID-19 disease. METHODS: In March 2020, ten terminally-ill, critical COVID-19 patients received two doses of leronlimab via individual emergency use indication (EIND). We analyzed changes in clinical presentation, immune cell populations, inflammation as well as SARS-CoV-2 plasma viremia before and 14 days after treatment. RESULTS: Over the 14 day study period 6/10 patients survived, 2 extubated, and 1 patient was discharged. We observed complete CCR5 receptor occupancy in all donors by day 7. Compared to baseline, we observed a concomitant statistically significant reduction of plasma IL-6, restoration of the CD4/CD8 ratio, and resolution of SARS-CoV2 plasma viremia (pVL) compared to controls. Further, the increase in CD8% was inversely correlated with reduction in pVL (r = −0.77, p = 0.0013). CONCLUSIONS: While the current study design precludes clinical efficacy inferences, these results implicate CCR5 as a therapeutic target for COVID-19 and form the basis for ongoing randomized clinical trials.</td>
