      <td>IntroductionOne of the noted features of COVID-19 is the spectrum of expressivity in symptoms among those with the disease, ranging from no or mild symptoms that may last a small number of days, to severe and/or longer lasting symptoms. It is emerging that many patients have long lasting symptoms, several months after initial infection with COVID-19. The aim of this research was to characterize post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (PACS). MethodsThis was a retrospective cross-sectional observational study. Participants were patients recovering from COVID-19 infection, enrolled in Mount Sinai Hospitals COVID-19 Precision Recovery Program (PRP). Inclusion criteria were confirmed or probable (based on World Health Organization criteria) initial diagnosis of COVID-19; post-acute COVID-19 syndrome (defined as experiencing symptoms &gt; 6 weeks since acute symptom onset) and being currently enrolled in the PRP during the months of July and August 2020. Study survey data were collected using REDCap. Demographic data, COVID-19 clinical data and patient-reported outcomes for breathlessness (Medical Research Council Breathlessness Scale), fatigue and quality of life (EuroQoL 5D-5L) were collected. Results84 individuals with PACS were included. Symptoms persisted at mean (range) 151 (54 to 255) days. The most prevalent persistent symptoms were fatigue (92%), loss of concentration/memory (74%), weakness (68%), headache (65%) and dizziness (64%). Most participants reported increased levels of disability associated with breathlessness, increased fatigue and reduced quality of life. ConclusionsPersistent symptoms following COVID-19 infection are prevalent, debilitating and appear to affect individuals regardless of acute infection severity or prior health status. More detailed research is required in order to identify specific symptom clusters associated with PACS, and to devise effective interventional strategies.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: The global pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has potentially affected liver transplantation (LT) programs worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether the COVID-19 outbreak affected organ donation and LT activity in France. METHODS: Data on the number of brain-dead donor procurements and adult liver transplantations were compared between two periods (1(st) January- 31(st) May 2019 vs. 1(st) January-31(st) May 2020). MAIN FINDINGS: There was a 28% decrease in the number of organ donations in 2020 (543 in 2020vs. 752 organ donations in 2019). A 22% decrease in the number of liver transplantations was also observed: 435 in 2020 vs. 556 LTs in 2019. Overall, the North East area which was the main COVID-19 cluster area, had &gt; 25% decrease of the multiorgan procurement (-33% compared to 2019), and liver transplantation (-26% compared to 2019) activities in 2020 CONCLUSION: This analysis confirmed that during the COVID-19 outbreak there was a significant decrease in the number of organ donations and liver transplantations performed in France.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Preliminary reports suggest a hypercoagulable state in COVID-19. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is perceived as a frequent finding in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but data describing the prevalence of DVT are lacking. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to report the prevalence of DVT in COVID-19 patients in general wards, blinded to symptoms/signs of disease, using lower extremities duplex ultrasound (LEDUS) in random patients. We tested the association of DVT with clinical, laboratory and inflammatory markers and also reported on the secondary endpoint of in-hospital mortality. PATIENTS/METHODS: n = 263 COVID-19 patients were screened with LEDUS between March 01, 2020 and April 05, 2020 out of the overall n = 1012 admitted with COVID-19. RESULTS: DVT was detected in n = 67 screened patients (25.5%), n = 41 patients (15.6%) died during the index hospitalization. Multiple logistic regression demonstrated that only C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.009, 95% CI 1.004–1.013, p &lt; 0.001) was independently associated with the presence of DVT at LEDUS. Both age (odds ratio 1.101, 95% CI 1.054–1.150, p &lt; 0.001) and C-reactive protein (odds ratio 1.012, 95% CI 1.006–1.018, p &lt; 0.001) were instead significantly independently associated with in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The main study finding is that DVT prevalence in COVID-19 patients admitted to general wards is 25.5%, suggesting it may be reasonable to screen COVID-19 patients for this potentially severe but treatable complication, and that inflammation, measured with serum C-reactive protein, is the main variable associated with the presence of DVT, where all other clinical or laboratory variables, age or D-dimer included, are instead not independently associated with DVT.</td>

      <td>Background: Ten months after its appearance in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 25 million patients worldwide. Because children were first identified as potential spreaders of the virus, schools were closed in several countries. However, it rapidly became evident that the number of hospitalized children infected by SARS-CoV-2 was dramatically lower than that of adults. To date, only hypotheses have been raised to explain this difference, so it is of great importance to describe the presentation of this disease among children. Here, we describe a wide spectrum of COVID-19 manifestation in children in a dedicated pediatric unit in France. Methods: Patients hospitalized with COVID-19 who were diagnosed on the basis of either positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs and/or typical aspects in chest-computed tomography (CT) were included between March and May 2020 in Paris. Results: Twenty-three patients were included on the basis of positive RT-PCR (n = 20) and/or typical aspects in CT (n = 4). The median age was 4.9 years [0.1–17.6]. Patients were grouped by age (&lt;2 years old: n = 14, 61%; 2–10 years old: n = 2, 9%; &gt;10 years old: n = 7, 30%). Overweight or obesity was reported in only three patients. At presentation, the most frequent symptom in the overall cohort was fever (n = 18, 78%), followed by acute rhinitis (n = 9, 64%) and cough (n = 7, 50%) in the under 2-year-old group and cough (n = 4, 57%), fatigue, dyspnea and abdominal pain (n = 3, 43% each) in the over 10-year-old group. Five patients required ICU treatment, four of whom were aged &gt;10 years, two presented with acute myocarditis, and two were sickle cell disease patients who presented with acute chest syndrome. Discussion and conclusion: The youngest patients seem to present milder forms of COVID-19 without the need for ICU treatment and with a shorter length of hospitalization. More severe evolutions were observed in teenagers, with, however, favorable outcomes. Given the context of closed schools and confinement, the infection of these children suggests intra-familial transmission that needs to be further assessed. This description might help to understand the intriguing differences in COVID-19 severity across age-classes.</td>

      <td>OBJECTIVE: It is known that the COVID-19 disease, which has affected the whole world, causes symptoms, such as cough, fever, shortness of breath, muscle pain, fatigue, diarrhea, headache and sore throat, in addition to various clinical findings, such as loss of smell and taste. In this study, we aimed to reveal the loss of sense of taste and smell in COVID-19 patients and to investigate whether these sensory losses are permanent in the healing process of the disease. METHOD: This prospective study included 94 COVID-19 patients. Smell and taste tests were applied to all patients. Ten days after the first test, a second test was applied to the patients with an impaired sense of smell to compare the results. RESULTS: Of the 94 patients, 55.3% were male, and the mean age was 53 ± 19.6 (21–90) years. There were 67 patients with smell and taste impairment, of whom 34 (50.7%) had smell impairment only, 3 (4.4%) had taste impairment only, and 30 (44.7%) had both smell and taste impairment. It was found that the smell scores of 55 patients with smell and taste impairment in the first evaluation were significantly higher at the second measurement; and their tasting period was significantly shortened compared to the first measurement (p˂0.001). CONCLUSION: COVID-19 patients may present to medical centers with a broad variety signs and symptoms. This study shows that impairment in the senses of smell and taste is common in this disease and strongly associated with COVID-19 infection. However, smell and taste impairment is mostly temporary and improves during the recovery period.</td>

      <td>The ongoing outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has taken a significant toll on people and countries all over the world. The pathogenesis of COVID-19 has not been completely elucidated yet. This includes the interplay between inflammation and coagulation which needs further investigation. The massive production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines results in the so-called cytokine storm, leading to plasma leakage, vascular hyperpermeability, and disseminated vascular coagulation. This is usually accompanied by multiorgan failure. The extensive changes in the serum levels of cytokines are thought to play a crucial role in the COVID-19 pathogenesis. Additionally, the viral load and host inflammation factors are believed to have a significant role in host damage, particularly lung damage, from SARS-CoV-2. Interestingly, patients exhibit quantitative and qualitative differences in their immune responses to the virus, which can impact the clinical manifestation and outcomes of COVID-19. There needs to be a better understanding of the dynamic events that involve immune responses, inflammatory reactions, and viral replication in the context of the COVID-19 infection. Here, we discuss the main aspects of COVID-19 pathogenesis while supporting the hypothesis that inflammatory immune responses are involved in the progression of the disease to a more critical and fatal phase. We also explore the similarities and differences between severe COVID-19 and sepsis. A deeper understanding of the COVID-19 clinical picture as it relates to better-known conditions such as sepsis can provide useful clues for the management, prevention, and therapy of the disease.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: The current outbreak of pandemic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) aggravates serious need for effective therapeutics. Over recent years, drug repurposing has been accomplished as an important opportunity in drug development as it shortens the time consumed for development, besides sparing the cost and the efforts exerted in the research and development process. MAIN BODY OF THE ABSTRACT: The FDA-approved antiparasitic drug, nitazoxanide (NTZ), has been found to have antiviral activity against different viral infections such as coronaviruses, influenza, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and other viruses signifying its potential as a broad spectrum antiviral drug. Moreover, it has been recently reported that NTZ exhibited in vitro inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 at a small micromolar concentration. Additionally, NTZ suppresses the production of cytokines emphasizing its potential to manage COVID-19-induced cytokine storm. Furthermore, the reported efficacy of NTZ to bronchodilate the extremely contracted airways can be beneficial in alleviating COVID-19-associated symptoms. SHORT CONCLUSION: All these findings, along with the high safety record of the drug, have gained our interest to urge conductance of clinical trials to assess the potential benefits of using it in COVID-19 patients. Thus, in this summarized article, we review the antiviral activities of NTZ and highlight its promising therapeutic actions that make the drug worth clinical trials.</td>

      <td>BACKGROUND: Although many patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) require direct admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), some are sent after admission. Clinicians require an understanding of this phenomenon and various risk stratification approaches for recognizing these subjects. METHODS: We examined all Covid-19 patients sent initially to a ward who subsequently required care in the ICU. We examined the timing transfer and attempted to develop a risk score based on baseline variables to predict progressive disease. We evaluated the utility of the CURB-65 score at identifying the need for ICU transfer. RESULTS: The cohort included 245 subjects (mean age 59.0 ± 14.2 years, 61.2% male) and 20% were eventually sent to the ICU. The median time to transfer was 2.5 days. Approximately 1/3rd of patients were not moved until day 4 or later and the main reason for transfer (79.2%) was worsening respiratory failure. A baseline absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) of ≤0.8 10(3)/ml and a serum ferritin ≥1000 ng/ml were independently associated with ICU transfer. Co-morbid illnesses did not correlate with eventual ICU care. Neither a risk score based on a low ALC and/or high ferritin nor the CURB-65 score performed well at predicting need for transfer. CONCLUSION: Covid-19 patients admitted to general wards face a significant risk for deterioration necessitating ICU admission and respiratory failure can occur late in this disease. Neither baseline clinical factors nor the CURB-65 score perform well as screening tests to categorize these subjects as likely to progress to ICU care.</td>
      <td>OBJECTIVES: To delineate the evolution of CT findings in patients with mild COVID-19 pneumonia. METHODS: CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. RESULTS: Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of ≥ 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: While bilateral GGO are predominant features, CT findings changed during different time intervals in the 3 weeks after symptom onset in patients with COVID-19. KEY POINTS: • Four of 88 (4.5%) patients with COVID-19 had negative initial CT. • Majority of COVID-19 patients had abnormal CT findings in ≥ 3 lobes. • A proportion of patients with pure ground glass opacities decreased over the 3 weeks after symptom onset.</td>

Using a multidisciplinary approach, we identified and validated the hepatitis C virus (HCV) protease inhibitor simeprevir as an especially promising repurposable drug for treating COVID-19. Simeprevir potently reduces SARS-CoV-2 viral load by multiple orders of magnitude and synergizes with remdesivir in vitro. Mechanistically, we showed that simeprevir inhibits the main protease (Mpro) and unexpectedly the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp).

      <td>BACKGROUND: Determining the infectiousness of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 is crucial for patient management. Medical staff usually refer to the results of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests in conjunction with clinical symptoms and computed tomographic images. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 62-year-old Japanese man who twice had positive and negative test results by polymerase chain reaction for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 over 48 days of hospitalization, including in intensive care. His respiratory symptoms and computed tomographic imaging findings consistent with coronavirus disease 2019 improved following initial intensive care, and the result of his polymerase chain reaction test became negative 3 days before discharge from the intensive care unit. However, 4 days after this first negative result, his polymerase chain reaction test result was positive again, and another 4 days later, he had a negative result once more. Eight days after the second polymerase chain reaction negative test result, the patient’s test result again became positive. Finally, his polymerase chain reaction results were negative 43 days after his first hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes the importance of repeat polymerase chain reaction testing and diagnosis based on multiple criteria, including clinical symptoms and computed tomographic imaging findings. Clinical staff should consider that a negative result by polymerase chain reaction does not necessarily certify complete coronavirus disease 2019 recovery.</td>

      <td>Physical exercise is seen as the main ally for health promotion, preventing and protecting the organism from several diseases. According to WHO, there is a tendency of constant growth in the elderly population in the coming years. The regular practice of exercises by the elderly becomes relevant to minimize the deleterious effects of the aging process and to increase the fitness index. Recently, the world population started a confrontation against Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19), which is the most significant public health challenge globally. Although social isolation is a reasonable measure in an attempt to stop contamination by COVID-19, this measure has limited the ability of individuals to exercise outdoors or in gyms and health clubs, which increased the risk of developing chronic illnesses related to a sedentary lifestyle. The critical point is that the recent recommendations on exercise prescription to combat the potentially harmful effects of COVID-19 failure to adequately address resistance exercise interventions as home-based exercise strategy. Thus, in this paper, we discussed the physical exercise as medicine if the training status is enough to protect the elderly against COVID-19 infection, about the role of physical activity on immunosuppression. Possible risks for COVID-19 infection, and the old training methods, such as no-load resistance training as possible resistance exercise strategies and high-intensity interval training, as new proposals of home-based exercise interventions, could perform during the current COVID-19 pandemic.</td>
      <td>BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS CoV-2) and was declared a worldwide pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020 which is leading to significant morbidity and mortality. In compliance with WHO recommendation of movement restrictions, many countries have imposed compulsory self-quarantine and restricted movements of their citizenries (lockdown/sit at home) and closure of businesses and borders as preventive measures to the fast-spreading virus. Consequently, this decision has made the emergence of behaviors that are detrimental to cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) which are the leading cause of the global mortality rate. MAIN BODY: The increase in sedentary lifestyles, alcohol consumption, and substance abuse during COVID-19 pandemic lockdown as a result of personal restrictions in COVID-19 lockdown is linked with the risk of death from chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). CONCLUSION: The lockdown has increased risk factors of CVDs, and as such, there might be an increase in the number of non-communicable disease (NCD)-related mortality rate. The effect does not end during the period of coronavirus pandemic but even after the pandemic.</td>
